------------------

Installs the graphite_ web application.

* started via upstart_
* uwsgi_ running the django application listening on ``/var/run/graphite/socket``

``graphite.nginx``
------------------

Installs nginx_ server to serve the graphite_ website. Very minimal
configuration mostly indented of testing. I recommend managing NOT
using this state and including the nginx_ config files created by
``graphite.uwsgi``

Known Issues
============

* the upstart scripts for the ``carbon-*`` daemons is a bad hack. The
  carbon daemons perform their own daemonization, and this does not
  play nicely with upstart. To work around this, all operations on
  carbon daemons are accomplished via ``pre-start`` and ``pre-stop``
  config
